# Cyras_Bag_O_Tricks
Cyra's portfolio of projects and accomplishments

Greetings and Salutations! I'm Cyra.  I'm a Full Stack developer and a graphic design weirdo!

I am a web developer and graphic design artist.  Just recently, I graduated from Thinkful's Full Stack Immersion program and 
Rasmussen's Graphic Design Program.  Coding intrigues me due to the plethora of solutions available to a problem.  
Watching and idea go from planning to implementation feels like creating a new life.  
That shout of 'It Works!' is ultimately rewarding!  I enjoy checking out code everywhere and making punny code jokes.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing with my dogs, whipping up creations in the kitchen, exploring a new destination 
or creating YouTube videos.  I love to learn and I'm always looking for new subjects to tackle.  My current explorations are 
Korean, Russian, and Estonian, as well as guitar and ukulele. I'm also working on writing and illustrating my first sci-fi 
graphic novel.
